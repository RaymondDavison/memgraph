# Memgraph Documentation

## About Memgraph

Memgraph is a database platform for real-time transactional processing of
connected data.


an ACID compliant high performance transactional distributed
in-memory graph database featuring runtime native query compiling, lock free
data structures, multi-version concurrency control and asynchronous IO.

## The Property Graph Model

Property graph contains data points called **nodes** which hold any number of
data key-value-pairs. You can find about supported data types on the [openCypher
Query Language](open-cypher.md) page. Nodes can also have one or more labels
attached to them which gives you the ability to model different roles your data
points can play in your domain model.

You can model connections between nodes using the concept of **relationships**,
directed and named edges between two nodes that can also have key-value-pairs of
properties.
